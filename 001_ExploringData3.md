# **Use Case 1: Student Performance Overview**

### *(Cases, Variables, Levels of Measurement, Frequency Tables)*

**PDFs:** 1.01, 1.02

## **Scenario**

A lecturer wants to understand **how students performed** in a statistics quiz.

---

## **Concepts Used**

* **Cases**: individual students
* **Variables**: quiz score, gender, program
* **Levels of Measurement**:

  * Gender → *Nominal*
  * Program → *Nominal*
  * Quiz score → *Interval*

📌 **Strong opinion:**

> If you misclassify the level of measurement, every analysis after this is wrong.

## **Data Matrix (Raw Data Example)**

| Student | Gender | Program | Score |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| S1      | Male   | MBA     | 78    |
| S2      | Female | MBA     | 85    |
| S3      | Female | IT      | 62    |
| S4      | Male   | IT      | 90    |

This matrix is **not analysis yet** — it’s raw material.

---

## **Frequency Table (Score Distribution)**

| Score Range | Frequency |
| ----------- | --------: |
| 50–59       |         2 |
| 60–69       |         5 |
| 70–79       |         8 |
| 80–89       |         6 |
| 90–100      |         3 |

**What this tells us**

* Where scores cluster
* Whether results are concentrated or spread

---

## **Graph: Bar Chart / Histogram**

**Interpretation**

* Histogram shape hints at **difficulty level**
* Right-skew → many low scorers
* Left-skew → many high scorers

---

# **Use Case 2: Salary Analysis in an Organization**

### *(Mean, Median, Mode, Shape of Distribution)*

**PDFs:** 1.03, 1.04

## **Scenario**

HR wants to report **average salary**, but management suspects the figure is misleading.

---

## **Concepts Used**

* **Mean** → arithmetic average
* **Median** → middle value
* **Mode** → most common value
* **Distribution shape** → skewness

---

## **Salary Data (RM)**

| Employee | Salary |
| -------- | -----: |
| E1       |  3,000 |
| E2       |  3,200 |
| E3       |  3,300 |
| E4       |  3,500 |
| E5       | 18,000 |

---

## **Central Tendency Comparison**

| Measure | Value | Interpretation         |
| ------- | ----: | ---------------------- |
| Mean    | 6,200 | Inflated by CEO salary |
| Median  | 3,300 | Typical employee       |
| Mode    |  None | All values unique      |

📌 **My stance:**

> In skewed distributions, **median > mean** for “typical value”.

---

## **Graph: Distribution Shape**

**Interpretation**

* Right-skewed distribution
* Mean pulled toward extreme value
* Median is more robust

---

# **Use Case 3: Identifying Exceptional Students**

### *(Range, IQR, Boxplot, Standard Deviation, Z-Scores)*

**PDFs:** 1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 1.08

## **Scenario**

The university wants to identify **top performers and at-risk students** fairly.

---

## **Concepts Used**

* **Range** → overall spread
* **Interquartile Range (IQR)** → middle 50%
* **Standard Deviation (SD)** → typical distance from mean
* **Z-score** → relative position

---

## **Score Summary**

* Mean = 70
* SD = 10

---

## **Z-Score Formula**

[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
]

### Example

Student score = 90
[
z = \frac{90 - 70}{10} = +2.0
]

**Interpretation**

* Student is **2 SD above mean**
* Clearly exceptional performer

---

## **Boxplot (Outliers & Spread)**

**What Boxplots Reveal**

* Median location
* IQR (spread of typical students)
* Outliers (extreme high / low scores)

📌 **Important exam insight:**

> Boxplots are resistant to outliers — unlike mean & SD.

---

## **Decision Framework (Practical Use)**

| Tool    | Best Used For         |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Mean    | Symmetric data        |
| Median  | Skewed data           |
| SD      | Overall variability   |
| IQR     | Typical spread        |
| Z-score | Individual comparison |

# **One-Page Concept Map (How 1.01–1.08 Connect)**

| Step | Question             | Tool                 |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | What data do I have? | Cases & variables    |
| 2    | How is it measured?  | Level of measurement |
| 3    | How often?           | Frequency table      |
| 4    | What’s typical?      | Mean / Median / Mode |
| 5    | How spread out?      | Range / IQR / SD     |
| 6    | Who stands out?      | Z-scores             |
